# Lemin-Ant

- In this project, we have developed an algorithm that will allow the ants to reach the 'end' room in the shortest number of turns without overlapping with each other through the graph created according to the specified coordinates.
After finding all possible paths between the start and end rooms with the BFS algorithm, we have to move the maximum number of ants to the end room without overlapping in each round according to the movements of the ants.

# WARNING 

- When you run the project with the command ' **go run main.go coordinate txt file** ', 
- if you get go mod error with version error <br>
 go mod init ant <br>
go mod tidy  <br> commands to run it.
